	Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine 
	I'm leaving my life in your hands 

	People say I'm crazy and that I am blind 
	Risking it all in a glance 

	And how you got me blind is still a mystery 
	I can't get you out of my head  

	Don't care what is written in your history 
	As long as you're here with me 

	I don't care who you are 
	Where you're from 
	What you did

	As long as you love me 
	Who you are 
	Where you're from 
	Don't care what you did 

	As long as you love me 

	Every little thing that you have said and done
	Feels like it's deep within me
	 
	Doesn't really matter if you're on the run 
	It seems like we're meant to be
	 

	I don't care who you are 

	Where you're from 
	What you did

	As long as you love me  

	Who you are 
	Where you're from 
	Don't care what you did 

	As long as you love me 

	As long as you love me 
	As long as you love me  

	I've tried to hide it so that no one knows 

	But I guess it shows

	When you look into my eyes 
	What you did and where you're comin' from 

	I don't care, as long as you love me, baby  

	I don't care who you are 
	Where you're from 
	What you did

	As long as you love me 
	Who you are 
	Where you're from 
	Don't care what you did 

	As long as you love me 

	Who you are 
	Where you're from 

	what you did 

	as long as you love me 
	Who you are 
	Where you're from  

	as long as you love me 
	Who you are 

	as long as you love me 
	What you did 

	I don't care

	as long as you love me
